My research plays an important role in my pedagogy. While at UT-Austin, I taught the XYZ. Since 2014, I have taught courses on XYZ at Howard University. I was also invited to teach in the Global July Program at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora in Brazil during the summer of 2018. 

You can find a selection of my student digital projects, including all of the XYZ, [here](/teaching-materials).
