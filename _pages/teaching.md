My research plays an important role in my pedagogy. While at UT-Austin, I taught a course based on my research on contemporary Brazilian urban literary productions. Since 2014, I have taught courses on Afro-Brazilian culture and literature at Howard University. I was also invited to teach in the Global July Program at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora in Brazil during the summer of 2018. 

You can find a selection of my student digital projects at the following omeka exhibit:
