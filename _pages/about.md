Welcome! I teach in the
[Department of World Languages and Cultures](https://wlc.howard.edu/) 
at [Howard University](https://howard.edu/). I specialize
in Latin American urban literature and culture. I earned my Ph.D in
Spanish and Portuguese from the
[University *of* Texas *at* Austin(https://www.utexas.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets.
My [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political
violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models,
geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I
also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic
statecraft. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both international
relations and quantitative methodology.
