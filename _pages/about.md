Welcome! I am currently a faculty member of the
[Department of World Languages and Cultures](https://wlc.howard.edu/) 
at [Howard University](https://howard.edu/). I specialize
in Latin American urban literature and culture. I earned my Ph.D in
Spanish and Portuguese from the
[University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/spanish/).

My recent [publications](publications) contextualize literary and cultural representations of the urban periphery as part of a larger analysis regarding the relationship between race, masculinity, and citizenship in contemporary Latin American urban spaces. My publications can be found in _Ipotesi: Revista de Estudos Literários_ and _Intinerários: Revista de Literatura_, among other outlets. My [research](research) examines theoretical frameworks of gender, race, and necropolitics in order to understand the social role of BIPOC contemporary literary and cultural productions within the context of the public sphere and its relationship to the city. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in contemporary Latin American literature, popular culture, and Afro-Latin American studies. 

I received an [ACLS Fellowship](https://www.acls.org/fellow-grantees/eliseo-jacob/) for the 2022-23 academic year to develop my current book project, _Masculinidades Marginais: Race, Gender, and Citizenship in São Paulo_, which is an examination of cultural productions produced by writers and artists from underrepresented communities in the Americas in order to understand how representations of male youth raise larger questions surrounding citizenship.  I assert that writers and artists from contemporary marginalized urban communities in Latin America are employing creative strategies that are inherently political due to their ability to contest hegemonic discourses on how Black and brown bodies can affirm their identities in the space of the city.
