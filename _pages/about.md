Welcome! I am currently a faculty member of the
[Department of World Languages and Cultures](https://wlc.howard.edu/) 
at [Howard University](https://howard.edu/). I specialize
in Latin American urban literature and culture. I earned my Ph.D in
Spanish and Portuguese from the
[University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/spanish/).

My recent [publications](publications) contextualize literary and cultural representations of the urban periphery as part of a larger analysis regarding the relationship between race, masculinity, and citizenship in contemporary Latin American urban spaces. My publications can be found in _Ipotesi: Revista de Estudos Literários_ and _Intinerários: Revista de Literatura_, among other outlets. My [research](research) expores X,Y, and Z in order to understand A,B, and C. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in X and Y areas.

My current book project, _Masculinidades Marginales: Race, Masculinity, and the City in Latin American Literature_, is an examination of literature produced by writers from underrepresented communities in major Latin American cities at the turn of the 21st century in order to understand how representations of male youth raise larger questions surrounding citizenship.  He asserts that writers from contemporary marginalized urban communities in the Americas are employing creative strategies that are inherently political due to their ability to contest hegemonic discourses on how Black and brown bodies can affirm their identities in the space of the city.
